** Introduction to CZTS

   - Copper zinc tin sulfide
   - Thin-film absorber layer for earth-abundant PV
   - p-type "copper-poor" material typically produced
   - Poor reproducibility between experimental groups
   - Major concerns are low open-circuit voltage and presence of secondary phases

   #+REVEAL: split

   - Reproducibility is a big problem
   - Many compositions are being reported
     [[./images/lit_cuttings.jpg]]

   #+REVEAL: split

   - There is evidence for some compositional flexibility;
     single-crystal measurements

   - But there are also micrographs suggesting competing
     phases

** Project aims

   - Explore stability of CZTS and secondary phases over a range of
     thermodynamic conditions
   - Relate these constraints to real processing conditions
   - Support development of rapid roll-to-roll processing


* Methods

** /Ab initio/ calculations

   *FHI-aims* was used as the "workhorse" code

   | Feature                    | Benefit                                |
   |----------------------------+----------------------------------------|
   | All-electron               | No PP dependence, consistent reference |
   | Atom-centred basis         | Vacuum is cheap                        |
   | Optional periodic boundary | Combine accurate crystals and clusters |
   | Good scaling               | Make use of largest HPC facilities     |

** /Ab initio/ thermodynamics

   - Researchers often refer to DFT ground-state energy as "enthalpy"
     or "chemical potential"
   - This isn't even correct at absolute zero!
     - Missing zero-point energy (ZPE)

   \( E_0 + ZPE = U^0 = H^0 = A^0 = G^0 \)
   \( \mu = \frac{\partial G}{\partial n} \)

** Vibrational contributions

   - The largest thermal contribution is occupation of vibrational
     states
   - Molecules/clusters have a discrete set of vibrational energy
     levels
     - [[http://www.chemtube3d.com/vibrationsH2O.htm][Water example]]
   - Crystals have long-range interactions analogous to electronic bands

   #+REVEAL: split
   - Low-frequency "acoustic" modes are simple displacement waves
   - High-frequncy "optical" modes involve movement within unit cell

** Thermal occupation

[[./images/Sn-disp.png]]   

   - Phonon density of states is needed
   - Occupied with Bose-Einstein statistics to obtain \(U\) (internal energy)
   - From \(U\), \(C_v\), \(S\) etc. can be obtained by calculus

** Lattice dynamics

   - Phonopy package used to obtain phonon DOS and perform integration
   - Harmonic approximation: atoms in quadratic wells
   - Make finite displacements + calculate forces with DFT
   - Diagonalise force constants matrix to obtain...

   #+REVEAL: split

   - eigenvalues (frequencies) and eigenvectors (modes)

* Results

** Reaction energies

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
   - Investigate relative stability of phases against $T$, $P$
   - Initially looked at decomposition to binaries
   - → Sensitive to temperature, at low S pressure
   - Published in /J. Mater. Chem. A/ [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00892h][10.1039/c4ta00892h]]

** CZTS
   - Move to include ternary phases
   - Ternary phase diagrams with "open" sulfur content
   - Vary chemical potentials with two parameters:
     - temperature and pressure

** CZTS

** CZTS

   - Found very narrow stability region for CZTS without CTS
   - Presented at conferences, trying to write paper
   - Main finding of PhD thesis

* Sulfur

** Background

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 50%">
   - While developing CZTS stability models, found inconsistent treatment of sulfur
   - Known to consist of a mixture of allotropes
   - Typically one allotrope is assumed to represent vapour phase
   - Last model of mixture developed in 1970s, made a lot of assumptions

** Generating clusters
   - Evolutionary algorithm used to generate candidate clusters,
     compared with literature
   - Used a selection to populate equilibrium model

** Thermodynamics
   - Vibrations computed with range of DFT XC functionals
   - PBE0 frequencies with 96% scale factor provided best fit
   - Create "universal" chemical potential of sulfur atoms accounting for equilibrium as $f(T,P)$
   - Paper published in /Chem. Sci./ [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C5SC03088A][10.1039/C5SC03088A]]
